 # Space Shooter Combat Game in Python

This is a detailed explanation of the code for a space shooter combat game developed in Python using Pygame. The game features a spaceship controlled by the player, enemy spaceships, and a scoring system. The code is well-structured and includes various sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.

## Prerequisites:

- Python 3 or higher
- Pygame library installed

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

### 1. Importing Necessary Modules:

```python
import pygame
import random
import math
from pygame import mixer
```

These lines import the required modules for the game, including Pygame for game development, random for generating random values, math for calculations, and mixer for playing sounds.

### 2. Initializing Pygame and Mixer:

```python
mixer.init()
pygame.init()
```

These lines initialize Pygame and Mixer, which are essential for setting up the game environment and playing sounds.

### 3. Setting Up Game Window:

```python
screenWidth, screenHeight = 800, 600

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screenWidth, screenHeight))
pygame.display.set_caption("Space Shooter Combat")
```

These lines set the dimensions of the game window and set the window title.

### 4. Loading Game Assets:

```python
icon = pygame.image.load("D:\\Python Projects\\Projects\\Space Shooter Combat\\Images\\SpaceShooterCombatIcon.webp")
pygame.display.set_icon(icon)

backGround = pygame.image.load("D:\\Python Projects\\Projects\\Space Shooter Combat\\Images\\SpaceShooterBg.jpg")
backGround = pygame.transform.scale(backGround, (screenWidth, screenHeight))

spaceShipImage = pygame.image.load("D:\\Python Projects\\Projects\\Space Shooter Combat\\Images\\spaceShip.png")
spaceShipImage = pygame.transform.scale(spaceShipImage, (screenWidth/8, screenHeight/8))

enemiesImage = []
enemyX = []
enemyY = []
enemySpeedX = []
enemySpeedY = []
enemyNum = 6

for i in range (enemyNum):    
    enemiesImg = pygame.image.load("D:\\Python Projects\\Projects\\Space Shooter Combat\\Images\\enemies.png")
    enemiesImg = pygame.
